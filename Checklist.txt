Step One : Select Character - Also maybe display info stored in array/list:

1 Anton
2 Harry
3
4 etc

then when input for example 1
prints "Anton is a person blah blah blah, STATS"
Want this guy? y/n
n returns to character select, y continues.

list!
character, e.g. Anton.stats [11,11,12,11, etc] then to print "Strength" Anton.list[1]
