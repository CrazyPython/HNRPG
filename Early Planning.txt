Halo Night: The Python Game

**Possibly Multiplayer if it's not too difficult to do** (and a trading system might be good too)

Plot:
A group of friends are absorbed into a videogame, but not one of those cool ones with the fancy pants graphics, no, a shit house one which runs on dos. (Well a python shell, but that's irrelevant)

Objective: Get out of this videogame world back to the real one, or at least to one where they can punch trees with their bare hands, or where they can think with portals.
